# Nomos

**Nomos is a semantic game runtime designed for AI authors. The Signed World is
the architectural thesis this repository tests.**

> The agent proposes the world. Nomos supplies the law.

The practical goal is to make coherent game worlds easier for AI authors to
build: describe a place through a bounded vocabulary, let shared rules own its
consequences, and inspect or reproduce the result. A useful visual vocabulary
must produce places people actually want to look at. Consistency alone is not
the finish line. This remains a research goal, not a shipped capability.

New machine or new agent? Read [the current handoff](docs/HANDOFF.md) before
choosing work. It contains the fresh-box prerequisites, proof order, exact stop
line, and operational gotchas.

## Next visible result

**One real reference scene, rendered at ordinary play size, that Peter wants
to look at.** Start with the [reference-scene brief](experiments/look-kernel/README.md)
for [issue #205](https://github.com/TusanHomichi/nomos/issues/205), using the
existing gaol target pack as taste evidence rather than runtime assets.

Define the bounded candidate and its checks prospectively, build the reference
slice, and put its actual rendered frame in front of the owner before expanding
the scene set. After reference approval and the complete experiment freeze,
two independent authors must create materially different scenes using content
edits only. Report visual quality, authoring effort, and technical/boundary
evidence separately; all existing acceptance requirements still apply.

The reference scene has not been implemented or accepted. Runtime expansion
remains paused: R1 stays intact, R2 stays stopped, and no game integration is
authorized. A rejected reference stops for owner disposition. An accepted
reference alone does not complete the experiment or authorize promotion.

## Status

| Line | Current disposition |
| --- | --- |
| The Signed World thesis | exploratory; applies to no game project |
| Gate K round one | failed under decision 0013 |
| Gate K round two | terminated incomplete under decision 0016 |
| R1 runtime epoch | all five criteria passed; accepted and closed under decision 0019 |
| R1 contract | `RUNTIME.md` revision 4, in force under decision 0021 |
| Game adoption | not authorized |
| Mortal Estate evidence | bounded evidence produced one admitted dependency point, representative frame, and classified capability gap; no integration or adoption |
| R2 observed-scene epoch | stopped unadmitted under decision 0027 after the exact final-evidence visual family was owner-rejected |
| Look-kernel experiment | authorized under decision 0027; issue #205 is ready for a feature branch; implementation has not begun |

R1 is the accepted runtime baseline for this repository. That result does not
rewrite Gate K, pass a later gate, approve production art, or authorize Nomos
for another project. Decision 0019 is explicit: **accept R1; do not adopt Nomos
into a game.**

Decision 0022 authorized one bounded presentation-adoption evidence program for
The Mortal Estate. That program admitted an immutable R1 dependency point,
recorded a representative adopter frame, and reduced its presentation gap to an
adopter-neutral fixture classified `reusable missing Nomos capability`.

Decision 0023 opened one narrow R2 observed-scene presentation epoch from that
evidence. R2-1's strict carrier and compiler landed at
`cc47a7235f92d0ed460c7db5d178448b12fdba02`; R2-2 added the isolated offline
consumer and hash-frozen independent second scene through PR #198. The exact
draft final-evidence candidate on PR #201 passed its applicable proofs, but the
owner rejected its committed visual family. Decision 0027 therefore stops R2
unadmitted, preserves the landed and unmerged evidence, and authorizes one
future quarantined look-kernel experiment focused on deterministic coherent
visual authorship. No platform choice or game adoption is authorized.

The implementation includes:

- six dependency-free semantic kernel crates through SW-N: strict authoring,
  stable World IR, compiled projections and transitions, immutable runtime
  transactions, verified packages, replay, migration, and explanations;
- read-only effective-facts and entity-catalog projections;
- the R1 `nomos-render-plan` compiler and typed presentation boundary;
- the R1 `nomos-play` native/wasm runtime for actors, movement, pursuit,
  receipts, sessions, and replay; and
- `apps/nomos-viewer`, an accepted offline viewer with vendored Three.js,
  strict decoders, scanned artifacts, native/browser session identity, and a
  bounded headless-Chromium proof; plus
- the stopped, unadmitted R2 `nomos-observed-scene` carrier/compiler and isolated
  `apps/nomos-observed-viewer`, with strict render-only decoding and two-scene
  offline browser evidence retained after the rejected final visual verdict.

The proof corpus connects six independently authored areas from the
quarantined executable-gaol study through one route. Two were cold-authored
from the packet alone. The study remains non-authoritative even though accepted
R1 code consumes its published artifacts as a specification and comparison
target.

Audio, networking, replication, combat, production scaling, and the adopting
game's Gate 0/Gate 1 evidence do not exist here.

## Proof

The pinned toolchain is Rust 1.98.0 with `rustfmt`, `clippy`, and
`wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The workspace has no third-party Cargo dependency;
Three.js is vendored with its license and digest. No `npm install` is needed.

Run the accepted workspace proof from a clean checkout:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo xtask boundary
```

Run the six-area artifact and browser proof in this order:

```bash
experiments/executable-gaol/gaol verify
crates/nomos-play/build-wasm.sh
cargo build --locked -p nomos-play
node apps/nomos-viewer/build.mjs \
  --from target/executable-gaol \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/wasm/nomos_play.wasm \
  --out apps/nomos-viewer/dist \
  --receipt target/nomos-viewer-build/receipt.json
node --test apps/nomos-viewer/test/*.test.mjs
node apps/nomos-viewer/smoke/smoke.mjs \
  --dist apps/nomos-viewer/dist \
  --out target/nomos-viewer-smoke \
  --require-chrome
```

The browser lane requires Node 22 or newer and Chrome/Chromium; set
`CHROME_BIN` when discovery cannot find the binary. See
[docs/HANDOFF.md](docs/HANDOFF.md) for complete setup and worktree rules.

The handoff retains the historical R2-2 commands so its evidence remains
auditable. Decision 0027 stops that acceptance line; do not launch a new R2
proof or repair run.

## Starting new work

Open issues, open pull requests, and owner decisions identify active work. Old
remote branches do not. Ordinary maintenance begins with a falsifiable issue
and follows [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). A new capability family, dependency policy,
runtime epoch, Gate K attempt, or game adoption requires a new owner decision.

Decision 0027 stops the observed-scene R2 epoch. No R2 repair, rerun, or merge
is active. Decision 0027 landed through PR #206; the next authorized capability
action is issue #205's separately falsifiable quarantined look-kernel
experiment.
That experiment must test actual-play-size visual coherence from one frozen
executable kit with one reference scene and two content-only cold-authored
scenes. It cannot satisfy acceptance or authorize another project.

Nomos is authority only for this repository. Nothing here becomes authority for
another project without that project's own explicit decision.
